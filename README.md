# Once upon a time, there was a boy named Hagrid living in Old Town. 
# From far away, you wouldn't suspect he has magical powers. His father was a wizard.
# One day, a local town villager found out about their magical powers and decided a mob would be a sufficient way to get rid of them.
# Hagrid's dad stayed behind to ward off the villagers while Hagrid ran away into the woods.
Hagrid left the old village with low spirits. 
On the winding road away from the village Hagrid came across a new village with odd but friendly people. 
Hagrid befriends these people and even participates in a local talent show, though he does sneak in some magic to win the judges over. 
While at this new village Hagrid decides to get a job at the local bakery and makes delicious magical treats. 
Hagrid is happy in this new village and plans to stay forever. 
Hagrid is having fun in his new village
But then the old village finds out he is hanging out with them
They are mad so they invade 
Hagrid uses his powers to defeat them when they get there
The new village says thank you and they live happily ever
