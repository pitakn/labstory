Hagrid left the old village with low spirits. 
On the winding road away from the village Hagrid came across a new village with odd but friendly people. 
Hagrid befriends these people and even participates in a local talent show, though he does sneak in some magic to win the judges over. 
While at this new village Hagrid decides to get a job at the local bakery and makes delicious magical treats. 
Hagrid is happy in this new village and plans to stay forever.
