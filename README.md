# Once upon a time, there was a boy named Hagrid living in Old Town. 
# From far away, you wouldn't suspect he has magical powers. His father was a wizard.
# One day, a local town villager found out about their magical powers and decided a mob would be a sufficient way to get rid of them.
# Hagrid's dad stayed behind to ward off the villagers while Hagrid ran away into the woods.
# After days of wandering in the woods, Hagrid made his way into New Town.
